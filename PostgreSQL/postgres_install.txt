Summary of the commands used to install PostgreSQL from the offical git repository.
This postgres installation was done on ArchLinux.

First, clone from the offical repo:
cd ~/Downloads/
git clone https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git

This took a while because of the amount of files are downloaded.

Next, configure and compile.
cd postgresql
mkdir build && cd build
../configure

Here I create a build directory where my computer-specific compilation and installation
settings will be created and run the configure script from the build directory.
This is the same procedure that cmake requires by default.

make
make check

I compile the source tree and run the makefile test suite to ensure everything is working.
For me, the compilation and check passed successfully on the first try.

su

I login to root to install postgres.

make install

I install postgres.

useradd -m postgres
mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data

Here I create a new user and home directory for postgres,
create a database directory and change the owner to the new user.

su - postgres
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb test
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql test

Finally I log into postgres from it's new home directory and initialize
a the database; postgres as a daemon to log all db actions; create and
try to access a database.

Done.
Postgres installed on ArchLinux.
